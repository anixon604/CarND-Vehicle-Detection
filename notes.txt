=============
FINAL PARAMETERS
color_space = YCrCb = 99.6% - performs slightly better from test and histogram observation
orient = 8
pix_per_cell = 16
cells_per_block = 4

hog_channel = 'ALL' because of distribution between random car/notcar pairs and lighting
spatial_size 24 - went to 98.9 when lowered to 16. so will keep. back up at 24
hist_bins = 16 bins fast operation and also histogram show enough resolution


HSV = 99.1




LUV didn't work for me.
